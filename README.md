## AKAI - Android Key Attestation Info
---

Utility application written for extracting properties of device's hardware-backed keys from attestation certificate's extension data.

Application is written mostly for learning and self-development purposes, however it can be used by developers/integrators for manual quick verification of attestation properties send to a server from a device. 

Application is inspired by Google's server sample: https://github.com/google/android-key-attestation
